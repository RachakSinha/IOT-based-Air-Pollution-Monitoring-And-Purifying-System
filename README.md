# IOT-based-Air-Pollution-Monitoring-And-Purifying-System

Developed and tested a prototype for an IoT-based air pollution monitoring and purifying system. Used ESP32, MQ135 sensor, buzzer, spray module, fan, relay, and LCD display. 
Successfully detected changes in air quality and activated the purifying system when needed. 
Overcame challenges in sensor calibration and achieved accurate readings. Real-time data displayed on a web interface. 
Demonstrated potential to improve air quality and promote healthier environments.
Future plans include field tests and integration with smart homes/buildings.
Improved air quality for healthier environments. Future-focused on field tests and integration with smart technology.
